# Assignment 2 - Kanban Board

In this second assignment, you will write an API for a
[`Kanban Board`](https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/kanban-board/) to be used by
a single person to manage tasks they have yet `todo`, tasks that are `in
progress`, and tasks that are `done`.  This application has a front-end web
app that will be useful as both a debugging tool, as well as a visualization
of how your API contributes to a successful product that a user can interact
